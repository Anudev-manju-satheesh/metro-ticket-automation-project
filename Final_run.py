# The model was trained using google colab (Tesla T4 GPU). Further details of model training are provided in the model training ipynb file and a clear function to clear the screen.

# This cell below will ask the input while initializing the system. The number of transactions expected per day should be given while initialization. So that the whole program will loop that many times meaning if 5 is given as input, we can get 5 tickets. After the 5 tickets are taken the program will be terminated.

# ### 8. Image capture
# This function opens up the camera of the device or the registered camera. In real case scenario these functions will be happening inside the machine. Since this is only just the code the notes have to be shown infornt of the camera one by one. 1st note should be shown and spacebar should be pressed to capture the image. If number of notes is more than 1 then other notes also have to be shown infront of the camera and spacebar should be pressed. The number of frames that can be captured is only equal to the user input of "number of notes".
